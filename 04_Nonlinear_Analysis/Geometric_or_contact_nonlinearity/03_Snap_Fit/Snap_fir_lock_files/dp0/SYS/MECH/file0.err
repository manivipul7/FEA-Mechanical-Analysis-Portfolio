 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.422   TIME= 08:57:28
 All selected contact pairs are initially open.  Rigid body motion can   
 occur.  You may use auto CNOF/ICONT by setting KEYOPT(5) to close       
 small gaps.

 Contact element 1398 (real ID 4) status changes abruptly from           
 no-contact -> contact (with target element 1169).

 Element 1140 (type = 1, PLANE183) (and maybe other elements) has become 
 highly distorted.  Excessive distortion of elements is usually a        
 symptom indicating the need for corrective action elsewhere.  Try       
 incrementing the load more slowly (increase the number of substeps or   
 decrease the time step size).  You may need to improve your mesh to     
 obtain elements with better aspect ratios.  Also consider the behavior  
 of materials, contact pairs, and/or constraint equations.  Please rule  
 out other root causes of this failure before attempting rezoning or     
 nonlinear adaptive solutions.  If this message appears in the first     
 iteration of first substep, be sure to perform element shape checking.
