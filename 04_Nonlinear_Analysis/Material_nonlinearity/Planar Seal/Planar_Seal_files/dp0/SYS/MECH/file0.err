 Hyper-elastic material may become unstable, material number 1 at        
 temperature 70.

 Pivoting has been activated for the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver .  
 The memory required may greatly exceed the predicted amount.  In that   
 event, use the DSPOPTION command to change the memory mode and/or       
 memory size used by the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver.

 A reference force value times the tolerance is used by the              
 Newton-Raphson method for checking convergence.  The calculated         
 reference FORCE CONVERGENCE VALUE = 0.240561337 is less than a          
 threshold.  This threshold is internally calculated.  You can           
 overwrite it by specifying MINREF on the CNVTOL command.  Check         
 results carefully.

 Element 389 (type = 1, PLANE183) (and maybe other elements) has become  
 highly distorted.  Excessive distortion of elements is usually a        
 symptom indicating the need for corrective action elsewhere.  Try       
 incrementing the load more slowly (increase the number of substeps or   
 decrease the time step size).  You may need to improve your mesh to     
 obtain elements with better aspect ratios.  Also consider the behavior  
 of materials, contact pairs, and/or constraint equations.  Please rule  
 out other root causes of this failure before attempting rezoning or     
 nonlinear adaptive solutions.  If this message appears in the first     
 iteration of first substep, be sure to perform element shape checking.
