 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.375   TIME= 09:21:01
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.

 Material number 8 (used by element 609) should normally have at least   
 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.                                          

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.750   TIME= 09:21:01
 Some of the nodes in the selected set were on beam elements for which   
 the SFDEL command is not valid.  Use the SFEDELE command instead.       

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.766   TIME= 09:21:01

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.859   TIME= 09:21:03

 the SFDEL command is not valid.  Use the SFEDELE command instead.       

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.859   TIME= 09:21:03
 To avoid duplication when using the LVSCALE command, delete all loads   
 unless already deleted.

 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.

 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.

 Element nodal forces were not requested (OUTRES,NLOAD) during the modal 
 solution.  Any subsequent reaction force output (e.g.  PRRSOL) will     
 therefore be of type STATIC only.
