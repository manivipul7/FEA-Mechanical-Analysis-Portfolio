 Element nodal forces were not requested (OUTRES,NLOAD) during the modal 
 solution.  Any subsequent reaction force output (e.g.  PRRSOL) will     
 therefore be of type STATIC only.

 Reading results into the database (SET command) will update the current 
 displacement and force boundary conditions in the database with the     
 values from the results file for that load set.  Note that any          
 subsequent solutions will use these values unless action is taken to    
 either SAVE the current values or not overwrite them (/EXIT,NOSAVE).

 The nodal coordinates were updated from their original locations during 
 a prior operation (an explicit UPCOORD or UPGEOM, or a linear
