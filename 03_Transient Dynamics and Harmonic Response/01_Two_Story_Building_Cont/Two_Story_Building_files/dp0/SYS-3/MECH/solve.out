 MATERIALS ONLY. KEYOPT(8) IS ALREADY SET AS SUGGESTED. KEYOPT(3)=2 
 IS SUGGESTED FOR HIGHER ACCURACY OF MEMBRANE STRESSES; OTHERWISE,
 KEYOPT(3)=0 IS SUGGESTED. KEYOPT(3) CAN NOT BE RESET HERE. PLEASE RESET 
 IT MANUALLY IF NECESSARY.

 ELEMENT TYPE         7 HAS KEYOPT(3)=2. FOR THE SPECIFIED ANALYSIS TYPE, LUMPED MASS
 MATRIX OPTION (LUMPM, ON) IS SUGGESTED.

 The Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver is currently running in the        
 in-core memory mode.  This memory mode uses the most amount of memory   
 in order to avoid using the hard drive as much as possible, which most  
 often results in the fastest solution time.  This mode is recommended   
 if enough physical memory is present to accommodate all of the solver   
 data.

 Reading results into the database (SET command) will update the current 
 displacement and force boundary conditions in the database with the     
 values from the results file for that load set.  Note that any          
 subsequent solutions will use these values unless action is taken to    
 either SAVE the current values or not overwrite them (/EXIT,NOSAVE).

 a prior operation (an explicit UPCOORD or UPGEOM, or a linear           
 perturbation analysis).
