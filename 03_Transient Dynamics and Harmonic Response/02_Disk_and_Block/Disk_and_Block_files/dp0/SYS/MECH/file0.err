 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.

 All selected contact pairs are initially open.  Rigid body motion can   
 occur.  You may use auto CNOF/ICONT by setting KEYOPT(5) to close       
 small gaps.                                                             

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.094   TIME= 17:32:09
 A reference force value times the tolerance is used by the              
 Newton-Raphson method for checking convergence.  The calculated         
 reference FORCE CONVERGENCE VALUE = 0 is less than a threshold.  This   
 threshold is internally calculated.  You can overwrite it by            
 specifying MINREF on the CNVTOL command.  Check results carefully.
